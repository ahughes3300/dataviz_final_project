## Mini-Project 2

- This project goes over the data from the 2017 Boston Marathon dataset found at <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reisanar/datasets/master/marathon_results_2017.csv>

- Spatial Visualization
The map is a map of the number of USA participants per state by sex for the 2017 Boston Marathon. The map is interactive and shows after Massachusetts that California has the highest number of participants. The information for male and female are very similar. 

- Linear Model Line Plot
The linear model plot shows the predict line of 10k, Half Race and 30K for predicting Finishing Time. It shows that times for distances later in the race have a larger effect than early times.

- Model Visualization Coefficient Plot
The linear model from the previous graph is plotting but coefficients. It shows the same trend of earlier distances times having less effect than later distance times. It also shwos that age has big effect on Finish times. 

-Interactive Shiny App
For this visualization go to the file Interactive_Viz.R and run the app. This has two selectable drop down menus that directly compare the times of two different participants for the top 300 participants.
